# Object-classification-in-depth

This repository uses a Realsense camera for object classification depending the distance from the camera. It is possible to recognize an object only if the distance between camera and object is near enough.

It uses OpenCV, numpy, Tensorflow and the Intel RealSense library pyrealsense2.`

```
pip install opencv-python 
pip install numpy 
pip install tensorflow 
pip install pyrealsense2 
```
